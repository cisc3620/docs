## Course objectives:
This course will concentrate on 3D image modeling. We will cover

* Fundamentals of computer graphics algorithms
* Basic OpenGL
* Topics including: geometric transformations, hierarchical modeling, visible surface algorithms, shading, ray tracing, global illumination, texturing, sampling, anti-aliasing.

## Text:
_Fundamentals of Computer Graphics_, 3rd Edition, by Peter Shirley & Steve Marschner, CRC Press, 2009. (Recommended)
_Real-Time Rendering_, 3rd Edition, by Tomas Akenine-Moller, Eric Haines, & Naty Hoffman, CRC Press, 2008. (Also good)
_3D Math Primer for Graphics and Game Development_, 2nd Edition, by Fletcher Dunn & Ian Parberry, CRC Press, 2011. (Helpful)

(FOCG and RTR both cover the topics covered in this class; we will not follow either one strictly. A textbook is not required but you will probably need one for reviewing the material covered in class.)

## Assignments:

There will be about ten coding assignments, approximately one each week. Each one will involve making incremental changes to provided code. The language of this class is C++; students are assumed to already be familiar with the language at an advanced level. Each assignment will be due the week after it is assigned unless otherwise noted; _assignments will not be accepted past the due date._

## Exams:

There will be a midterm in mid-March and a non-cumulative final.

## Grading:

* Coding assignments: 30% (10 x 3%)
* Midterm 30%
* Final 30%
* Attendance and participation 10%

## Plagiarism

The faculty and administration of Brooklyn College support an environment free from cheating and plagiarism. Each student is responsible for being aware of what constitutes cheating and plagiarism and for avoiding both. The complete text of the CUNY Academic Integrity Policy and the Brooklyn College procedure for policy implementation can be found at www.brooklyn.cuny.edu/bc/policies. If a faculty member suspects a violation of academic integrity and, upon investigation, confirms that violation, or if the student admits the violation, the faculty member MUST report the violation.

## Center for Student Disability Services

In order to receive disability-related academic accommodations students must first be registered with the Center for Student Disability Services. Students who have a documented disability or suspect they may have a disability are invited to set up an appointment with the Director of the Center for Student Disability Services, Ms. Valerie Stewart-Lovell at (718) 951-5538. If you have already registered with the Center for Student Disability Services, please provide your professor with the course accommodation form and discuss your specific accommodation with him/her.

## Non-attendance because of religious beliefs

The New York State Education Law provides that no student shall be expelled or refused admission to an institution of higher education because he or she is unable to attend classes or participate in examinations or study or work requirements on any particular day or days because of religious beliefs. Students who are unable to attend classes on a particular day or days because of religious beliefs will be excused from any examination or study or work requirements. Faculty must make good-faith efforts to provide students absent from class because of religious beliefs equivalent opportunities to make up the work missed; no additional fees may be charged for this consideration.
